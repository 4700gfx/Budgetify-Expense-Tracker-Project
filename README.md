# Budgetify Expense Tracker Project
This is an Expense Tracker that helps you to budget and keep track of simple transactions.
The main UI will contain a navbar, a dashboard, butons, a section for each transaction and a section for a overview of chart data.
When the program is started, we want to have a modal window that allows you to input transactions before entering the main window. 
After this is done, all the functionality will be mainly implemented within the the main window. 

# Main UI Information 
We want to have a simple but sleek interface that is easy on the eyes. We want to abide by the the conventional rules of UI.
The color palette, spacing and alignment is essential and should be done before adding any functionality for the program.
