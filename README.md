# Budgetify Expense Tracker Project
This is an Expense Tracker that helps you to budget and keep track of simple transactions.
The main UI will contain a navbar, a dashboard, butons, a section for each transaction and a section for a overview of chart data.
When the program is started, we want to have a modal window that allows you to input transactions before entering the main window. 
After this is done, all the functionality will be mainly implemented within the the main window. 

# Main UI Information 
We want to have a simple but sleek interface that is easy on the eyes. We want to abide by the the conventional rules of UI.
The color palette, spacing and alignment is essential and should be done before adding any functionality for the program. 
Find the color palette and font information below:

Color Palette:

Primary Color: rgba(13, 27, 42);
Secondary Color: rbga(27, 38, 59);
Tertiary Color/Text Color: rbga(224, 225, 221);
Lighter Color: rgba(65, 90, 119);
Lighter Color II: rgba(65, 90, 119);

font-family: "DM Sans", sans-serif;


# Main Functionality
In terms of functionality, we want to make sure that expense table works in tandenm with the Transaction Input Window. The Dashboard should update all of the totals of different categories. 

Different Categories:
- Deposits 
- Savings  
- Utlities 
- Main Bills 
- Subscriptions 
- Misc. 

Key Points of Functionality:

- All Inputs from the Transaction Windows are Inputted Into The Table Correctly
    - Implement Logic for When The Input Field is Not The Desired Input 
    - Add Negatives for Expenses and Positives for Deposits 
    - Logic to Require Input Before Starting with Budget

- All Dashboard Elements Reflect the Information Properly 
  - Total Budget
  - Total Balance/Spending 
  - Total Savings 
  - Current Budget 

- Allowing for Deleting, Saving and Searching Expenses 
  - Search for Expense by Name or ID 
  - Delete Expense by Button 
  - Save Expenses Over Time through Back End or Local Storage


- Chart Element that Reflects the Information from The Dashboard Elements

These key points will make for the MVP of this application. Once the logic and programming has been completed. We will work to add more modal windows and tightening up on the UI to increase the usability of this application.
